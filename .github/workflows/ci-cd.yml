# This workflow automates the CI/CD pipeline for Spring PetClinic:
# 1. Compiles and Tests the application (Java 21, skipping Java 25+ check).
# 2. Packages the application into a Docker image.
# 3. Pushes the image to JFrog Artifactory.
# 4. Publishes build info and runs an Xray security scan (gating the pipeline).
